### ColorPickerUdemy



###### About the Project</br>
A very simple JavaScript based game for getting good at RGB colors. I developed this game to put in practice what I learned while I took a UDEMY course on Javascript. I basically just applied all that was taught in the videos. An RGB color is randomly generated and you select which color you think it is based on deduction of the strength of each color from the given numbers. Each individual box disappears (display: none) as you click on it unless its the right one then all the boxes trun that color. You can start again and even go into easy (only 3 options to choose from) or hard mode.  </br> </br>
